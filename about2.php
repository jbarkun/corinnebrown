    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4"><i> Corinne Brown is known for creating warm, inviting and personal homes. Clients describe her as uniquely intuitive and a quick study, "she tuned into my taste and vision in a way I could never have expected. I was so relieved to be understood and knew that the whole process was going to be enjoyable from that point on" - a sentiment that has been expressed by dozens of clients.</i><br /><br />

        <i>As the owner and Principal Designer of The Brown Design Group, Corinne has found a way to combine her passion for design with a mountain lifestyle. Born and raised in Southern California, Corinne studied architecture at UCLA, then following her passion for skiing, she relocated to Mammoth Lakes almost 30 years ago. She found her way to the architectural firm of O'Connor Design Group, and later to The Finishing Touch Interior Design Studio, which she purchased in 1998. She now works from The Big Red Building, a spectacular design studio which she designed and built to house the largest sample library within a hundred mile radius.</i><br /><br />

        <i>She is a Professional Member of The American Society of Interior Designers, a Certified Designer in the State of California, as well as a member of the prestigious Design Trust. She maintains an incredible focus on honing the organization aspect of the business while continually seeking out innovative solutions.  Her keen eye, experience and ability to derive inspiration from the mountain lifestyle provides a special sense for what is important to her exclusive clientele.</i><br /><br />

        <i>Corinne and her team at The Brown Design Group have created an impressive portfolio of work, including outstanding mountain vacation home interior design, but she is most proud of the relationships that have been built with their clients, which continue through the years. "I think that we connect because we can provide designs that make them feel most comfortable and happy in real life. I find inspiration in their very personal desire to create a home". </i><br /><br />
